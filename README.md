# subProcess : Personal DJ Site

One hobby of mine is DJing. This site is my promotional dj site. There isn't much to it right now, however there are some plugins in the works that will be split off into separate repositories when they are ready for distribution. As this repository is public, you're free to use the code you see here, but beware: at this stage it's very early alpha.

### Installation

Assuming docker is installed, clone this repository and run the following:

```
source ./shell_helpers.sh
up
```
